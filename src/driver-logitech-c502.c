/** 
*
* driver for g502 mice since they have a G-Shift button. 
* Issue is that the actual hardware driver for G502 mice only knows the plain buttons as they are only physical switches. 
* Thus, the idea of G-Shift with its second layer for buttons is only virtual and because of this, we need a new driver file here at this point.
*
* WIP as of 20th of March 2025
